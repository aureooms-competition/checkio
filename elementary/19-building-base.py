#The singularity has happened and we are being made to build the ideal
#robo-city for our overlords. In this shining robotropolis, all buildings will
#be rectangular and all streets laid along south-north and east-west lines in a
#glorious grid. Before we get started, we to create a class to represent the
#perfect building.
#
#Because all the buildings in the city are rectangular and their walls are
#parallel to the streets, we can define any building using only the coordinates
#of South-Western corner as two arguments (the length of the west to east walls,
#and the length of the north to south wall) along with the height of the
#building. These values are described as positive numbers using conventional
#units. The origin point of our coordinate system lies in the South-West , as a
#result the northern corner ends up having the greater coordinate value than the
#southern corner. To complete this mission we need to use a couple operations.
#See the class description below.
#
#class Building(south, west, width_WE, width_NS, height=10)
#
#Returns a new Building instance with the South-West corner at [south, west]
#coordinates, the size is width_WE by width_NS and the height of the building is
#height. "height" is a positive number with a default value of 10.
#
#>>> Building(10, 10, 1, 2, 2)
#Building(10, 10, 1, 2, 2)
#>>> Building(0, 0, 10.5, 2.546)
#Building(0, 0, 10.5, 2.546, 10)
#
#
#corners()
#
#Returns a dictionary with the coordinates of the building corners. The
#dictionary has following keys: "north-west", "north-east", "south-west",
#"south-east". The values are lists or tuples with two numbers.
#
#>>> Building(1, 2, 2, 2).corners()
#{"north-west": [3, 2], "north-east": [3, 4], "south-west": [1, 2],
#"south-east": [1, 4]}
#
#
#area()
#
#Returns the area of the building.
#
#>>> Building(1, 2.5, 4.2, 1.25).area()
#5.25
#
#
#volume()
#
#Returns the volume of the building.
#
#>>> Building(1, 2.5, 4.2, 1.25, 101).volume()
#530.25
#
#
#__repr__()
#
#This is a string representation of the Building. This method is used for
#"print" or "str" conversion. Returns the string in the following view:
#"Building({south}, {west}, {width_we}, {width_ns}, {height})"
#
#>>> str(Building(0, 0, 10.5, 2.546))
#"Building(0, 0, 10.5, 2.546, 10)"
#
#
#In this mission all data will be correct and you don't need to implement value
#checking.
#
#Input: Statements and expression with the Building class.
#
#Output: The behaviour as described.
#
#Precondition: All data are correct.
