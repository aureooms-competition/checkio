#For the Robots the decimal format is inconvenient. If they need to count to
#"1", their computer brains want to count it in the binary representation of
#that number. You can read more about binary here.
#
#You are given a number (a positive integer). You should convert it to the
#binary format and count how many unities (1) are in the number spelling. For
#example: 5 = 0b101 contains two unities, so the answer is 2.
#
#Input: A number as a positive integer.
#
#Output: The quantity of unities in the binary form as an integer.
#
#Precondition: 0 < number â‰¤ 2**32
