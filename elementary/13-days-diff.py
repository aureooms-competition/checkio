#How old are you in number of days? It's easy to calculate - just subtract your
#birthday from today. We could make this a real challenge though and count the
#difference between any dates.
#
#You are given two dates as tuples with three numbers - year, month and day. For
#example: 19 April 1982 will be (1982, 4, 19). You should find the difference in
#days between the given dates. For example between today and tomorrow = 1 day.
#The difference will always be either a positive number or zero, so don't forget
#about absolute value.
#
#Input: Two dates as tuples of integers.
#
#Output: The difference between the dates in days as an integer.
#
#Precondition: Dates between 1 january 1 and 31 december 9999. Dates are
#correct.
